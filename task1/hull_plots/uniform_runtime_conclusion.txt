Conclusion for Uniform Distribution (Bounds [0, 1]):
As the number of points (n) increases, the runtime for each algorithm grows.
The algorithms generally scale with the complexity of their operations.
Graham Scan and Monotone Chain tend to have similar performance, with Quickhull being faster.
Jarvis March has the highest runtime, especially as n grows larger.
