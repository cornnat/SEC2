Conclusion for Point Cloud with Bounds [-5, 5]:
Changing the bounds to [-5, 5] doesn't show a significant difference in algorithm performance.
The scaling behavior remains the same, although the point cloud has a larger range.
We still observe the same ranking of algorithms from fastest to slowest.
